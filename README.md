Notes, Guides, and information on wargames, CTFs, etc that i have completed.

## OverTheWire

These wargames are my first attempt at learning the hacker mindset and doing CTF related games.

**Bandit** The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners. It will teach the basics needed to be able to play other wargames.

**Natas** Natas teaches the basics of serverside web-security.

**Leviathan** This wargame doesn't require any knowledge about programming - just a bit of common sense and some knowledge about basic *nix commands. We had no idea that it'd be this hard to make an interesting wargame that wouldn't require programming abilities from the players. Hopefully we made an interesting challenge for the new ones.
