# OverTheWire: Leviathan

Difficulty:     1/10
Levels:         8
Platform:   Linux/x86

**Description:** This wargame doesn't require any knowledge about programming - just a bit of common sense and some knowledge about basic *nix commands. We had no idea that it'd be this hard to make an interesting wargame that wouldn't require programming abilities from the players. Hopefully we made an interesting challenge for the new ones. Leviathan’s levels are called leviathan0, leviathan1, … etc. and can be accessed on leviathan.labs.overthewire.org through SSH on port 2223.
